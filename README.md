## Hello,

I am Hetav Desai. I'm currently a Software Engineer at Unacademy where my team and I work on building, optimising and scaling the live classroom streaming experience on the Unacademy platform, to enable seamless realtime experience for the learners and educators.

With a little more interest and strength on the frontend side of the things, I work with JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Redux, React Native and WebRTC; and I'm currently learning mobile development. I also have some experience with backend technologies like NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, GraphQL, and SQL.

Outside of the programming world, my hobbies include listening to music, playing piano keyboard, reading about personal finance, startups, and psychology and consuming podcasts, videos and other forms of content that help me broaden my perspective on various topics. I'm always looking for such resources, and good suggestions are always welcome!
