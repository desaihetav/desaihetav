## Hello,

I am Hetav Desai, a Frontend Developer. I focus on writing accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices and JavaScript. I am currently practising JavaScript, React and other major technologies in the React Ecosystem, by building projects with every new technology that I learn. I've also had experience working with Android, Flutter and Firebase.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing Piano, reading books or studying personal finance and psychology.
