  I'm Hetav Desai. I'm a Software Engineer at [Sundial](https://sundial.ai) where I build AI-native product systems end-to-end. Currently leading AI analytics agent development, 
  building agent orchestration, evaluation infrastructure, and streaming-first product experiences used by teams at OpenAI, Character, Gamma, and Google.

  I work with TypeScript, React, Python, FastAPI, LangGraph, and OpenAI / Claude / Gemini SDKs. Previously at [Unacademy](https://unacademy.com), where I built real-time
  collaborative systems across web and mobile.

  Outside of work, my hobbies include listening to music, playing piano keyboard, reading about personal finance, startups, and psychology and consuming podcasts,
  videos and other forms of content that help me broaden my perspective on various topics. Good suggestions are always welcome!
